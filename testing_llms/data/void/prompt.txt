You are an expert at programming python code. 
Write python code that extracts metadata from an RDF-File as specified in the VoID vocabulary, but only the predicate count and the class count
	1.	The predicate count: A count of all unique predicates in the RDF file.
	2.	The class count: A count of all unique RDF classes (i.e., objects of rdf:type triples).
The rdf file is stored at the path ./data/void/books.ttl. Store the result in a dictionary called result and print it at the end, like this (where the values are placeholders): 
```python
result = {
    'predicate_count': 'value',
    'class_count': 'value'
}
print(result)
```.
Just output the block of code without any additional text. Make sure the code works and compiles correctly.
