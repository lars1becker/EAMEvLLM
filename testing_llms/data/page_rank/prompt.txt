You are an expert at programming python code. 
Write python code that calculates the Page Rank scores for a given graph-file at the path ./data/page_rank/page_rank.gml. Store the result for each node in a dictionary called result and print it at the end, like this (where the values are placeholders): 
```python
result = {
    'A': 'value',
    'B': 'value',
    ...
}
print(result)
```.
Take the nodes as their labels and not their id.
Just output the block of code without any additional text. Make sure the code works and compiles correctly.
